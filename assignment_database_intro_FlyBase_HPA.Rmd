### Purpose {-}

The three activities in this assignment will give you a quick tour of several online databases for biological research and will teach you how to use these databases to gather information about genes.

### Learning Objectives {-}

1. Name two biological databases and briefly describe the types of information they each contain.
1. Use online databases to look up information about a gene.

### Introduction {-}
