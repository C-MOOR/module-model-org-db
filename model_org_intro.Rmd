## "Introduction to Model Organisms"

Scientists frequently use a few specific organisms, called "**model organisms**" for their experiments.  This tutorial will introduce you to a few of the most popular model organisms and will discuss why these organisms were chosen and what they are useful for.

### Learning Goals

  - 'Explain what a "model organism" is and why they are useful'
  - 'Define **ortholog** and explain how model organisms can be used to understand human genes.'
  - 'Name 4 commonly used model organisms'
  - 'Compare and contrast the pros and cons of different model organisms'
