#### Learning Goals {-}

- Use the Human Protein Atlas to look up proteins by name and find out where they are localized.

### What is the Human Protein Atlas?

The Human Protein Atlas is a website that organizes research results about human proteins.  It contains many types of information, including what the proteins do, where they are active, and what types of diseases they are involved in.  We can use it to find out what has been discovered about genes we’re interested in.

```

You will primarily interact with the Human Protein Atlas by typing the names of genes or proteins of interest into the search bar.

The boxes below the search bar ("Tissue Atlas", "Cell Atlas", etc.) provide explanations about the types of information available in the Human Protein Atlas.

#### Reminder: Genes and Proteins {-}

People sometimes use the names of a gene and the protein it "codes for" interchangeably, which can be a bit confusing.

- A **gene** is a DNA sequence (made of **nucleotides**).  It contains the instructions for how to make a specific protein.
- A **protein** is an **amino acid** sequence.  Proteins fold up into specific shapes that let them do their jobs.  Proteins perform the majority of functions in cells, including things like:
    - Carrying out chemical reactions
    - Moving materials around inside the cell
    - Transporting things in and out of a cell

Mutations in a *gene* can cause the *protein* to be made incorrectly, resulting in a protein that does not do its job properly.

Not all genes code for proteins; genes can have other types of information and instructions.  The Human Protein Atlas is focused specifically on proteins and the genes that code for them ("protein-coding genes").

### Protein Pages

Every protein in the Human Protein Atlas has its own page with a large collection of information about the protein.  To see what kinds of information is available, we will look at the entry for [**insulin**](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000254647-INS).

#### Protein Summary {-}

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the Summary section of the Human Protein Atlas page for INS.  It contains a table of information about the protein including its name (Insulin), Gene name (INS), Tissue specificity ('Tissue enriched (pancreas)') and Extracellular location (Secreted to blood).", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2021).

```

- **Gene name** - The name of the gene that codes for the protein.  If multiple names have been used for this gene, they will be listed in parentheses.  The gene for insulin is named “INS”.
- **Gene summary** (at the bottom) - A summary of what we know about this gene.  For insulin, it contains a description of how it is processed, and then an explanation of how it binds to the insulin receptor and stimulates glucose uptake.
- **Where is it located?** (Tissue specificity, Extracellular location, Brain specificity, Blood specificity, Predicted location) - The Human Protein Atlas has several types of information about the protein’s location.  More information is available further down on the page.
- **What does it do?** (Protein function, Molecular function, Biological process) - What molecular, chemical, and biological processes does it carry out?  Insulin is a hormone involved in carbohydrate metabolism.
- **Disease involvement** - Is it associated with any diseases?  Insulin is associated with diabetes as well as cancer.

Further down the page we can see more information about where the protein is located:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the Protein Expression and Localization and Tissue RNA Expression sections of the Human Protein Atlas page for INS.  It contains tables summarizing insulin localization.  The Tissue profile is 'Highly selective cytoplasmic expression in pancreatic islets'.", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2023).

knitr::include_graphics("assets/database_HPA/HPA_insulin_localization.png")
```

Insulin is located specifically in the pancreas.

#### Tissue Atlas {-}

If we click on the [Tissue Atlas tab](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000254647-INS/tissue), we can see more detailed information.  Partway down the page you can see diagrams of where the protein is located.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the Tissue tab of the Human Protein Atlas entry for INS.  It contains graphical summaries of insulin localization. A diagram of a human body has several areas colored lightly, and the pancreas colored darkly.  Bar plots for RNA and protein expression both show high expression in the pancrease and little to no expression anywhere else.  There are also images of different tissues stained to detect insulin expression - only the pancrease tissue has dark staining.", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2023).

```

Insulin is very cleanly localized to the pancreas.  Both the RNA and the protein experimental data show high expression in the pancreas and very little expression anywhere else.

#### Subcellular Localization  {-}

If we click on the **Subcell** tab, we can see more detailed information about where in a cell the protein can be found.

Insulin is secreted rather than remaining in the cell, so it doesn't have a subcellular localization.  Instead, let's look at the subcellular localization of the **insulin receptor** [INSR](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000171105-INSR/subcellular), which is the protein that detects the presence of insulin so that cells can respond to it.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the Subcell tab of the Human Protein Atlas entry for INSR.  It contains a table summarizing the subcellular localization of INSR.  It also contains a graphical summary of insulin receptor localization. A diagram of a cell has the plasma membrane and vesicles colored.", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2023).

```

The insulin receptor is located mainly on the *plasma membrane*.  This makes sense - it sits on the outside of the cell so that it can detect insulin.  It can also be found in *vesicles*, which transport materials to and from the plasma membrane.

#### Look up a Protein {-}

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a severe disease where individuals are unable to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine.  If untreated, children with PKU develop seizures and irreversible intellectual disabilities.  It can be controlled by maintaining a strict diet, and individuals can go on to live a normal life.  Babies are routinely screened for PKU shortly after birth, so that they can begin treatment immediately.

PKU is caused by deficiency in **phenylalanine hydroxylase** - the protein that processes phenylalanine.
