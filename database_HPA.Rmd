#### Learning Goals {-}

- Use the Human Protein Atlas to look up proteins by name and find out where they are localized.

### What is the Human Protein Atlas?

The Human Protein Atlas is a website that organizes research results about human proteins.  It contains many types of information, including what the proteins do, where they are active, and what types of diseases they are involved in.  We can use it to find out what has been discovered about genes we’re interested in.

```

You will primarily interact with the Human Protein Atlas by typing the names of genes or proteins of interest into the search bar.

The boxes below the search bar ("Tissue Atlas", "Cell Atlas", etc.) provide explanations about the types of information available in the Human Protein Atlas.

#### Reminder: Genes and Proteins {-}

People sometimes use the names of a gene and the protein it "codes for" interchangeably, which can be a bit confusing.

- A **gene** is a DNA sequence (made of **nucleotides**).  It contains the instructions for how to make a specific protein.
- A **protein** is an **amino acid** sequence.  Proteins fold up into specific shapes that let them do their jobs.  Proteins perform the majority of functions in cells, including things like:
    - Carrying out chemical reactions
    - Moving materials around inside the cell
    - Transporting things in and out of a cell

Mutations in a *gene* can cause the *protein* to be made incorrectly, resulting in a protein that does not do its job properly.

Not all genes code for proteins; genes can have other types of information and instructions.  The Human Protein Atlas is focused specifically on proteins and the genes that code for them ("protein-coding genes").

### Protein Pages

Every protein in the Human Protein Atlas has its own page with a large collection of information about the protein.  To see what kinds of information is available, we will look at the entry for [**insulin**](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000254647-INS).

#### Protein Summary {-}

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the Summary section of the Human Protein Atlas page for INS.  It contains a table of information about the protein including its name (Insulin), Gene name (INS), Tissue specificity ('Tissue enriched (pancreas)') and Extracellular location (Secreted to blood).", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2021).

knitr::include_graphics("assets/database_HPA/HPA_insulin_summary.png")
```

- **Gene name** - The name of the gene that codes for the protein.  If multiple names have been used for this gene, they will be listed in parentheses.  The gene for insulin is named “INS”.
- **Gene summary** (at the bottom) - A summary of what we know about this gene.  For insulin, it contains a description of how it is processed, and then an explanation of how it binds to the insulin receptor and stimulates glucose uptake.
- **Where is it located?** (Tissue specificity, Extracellular location, Brain specificity, Blood specificity, Predicted location) - The Human Protein Atlas has several types of information about the protein’s location.  More information is available further down on the page.
- **What does it do?** (Protein function, Molecular function, Biological process) - What molecular, chemical, and biological processes does it carry out?  Insulin is a hormone involved in carbohydrate metabolism.
- **Disease involvement** - Is it associated with any diseases?  Insulin is associated with diabetes as well as cancer.

Further down the page we can see diagrams depicting where the protein is located:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the Protein Expression and Localization section of the Human Protein Atlas page for INS.  It contains graphical summaries of insulin localization: Tissue Atlas (enriched in pancreas), Brain Atlas (not detected), Cell Atlas (not available), and Blood Atlas (secreted to blood).", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2021).

knitr::include_graphics("assets/database_HPA/HPA_insulin_localization.png")
```

Insulin is located specifically in the pancreas.

#### Tissue Atlas {-}

If we click on the [Tissue Atlas box](https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000254647-INS/tissue), we can see more detailed information:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the Tissue page of the Human Protein Atlas entry for INS.  It contains graphical summaries of insulin localization. A diagram of a human body is shown, and the pancreas is colored.  Bar plots for RNA and protein expression both show high expression in the pancrease and little to no expression anywhere else.  There are also images of different tissues stained to detect insulin expression - only the pancrease tissue has dark staining.", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2021).

```

Insulin is very cleanly localized to the pancreas.  Both the RNA and the protein experimental data show high expression in the pancreas and very little expression anywhere else.

### Look up a Protein

### Summary

The Human Protein Atlas is a useful source of information when researching human genes.  Some key features include:

- A convenient summary of what is known about the gene's function
- Information on disease associations
- Nice graphical depictions of where the protein is active
