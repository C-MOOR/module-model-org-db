<!-- I included these questions in reflecton boxes, as short answer rather than multiple choice -->

```{r, flybase-lab, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Look up the *lab* gene on FlyBase",
  question("What is the FlyBase ID number for *lab*?",
    answer("FBgn0002522", correct=TRUE),
    answer("FBgn0000024"),  
    answer("FBgn0000003"),
    answer("FBgn0001264"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("What biological processes is the *lab* gene involved in? HINT: Choose more than one answer.",
    answer("brain development", correct=TRUE),
    answer("midgut development", correct=TRUE),
    answer("immune system"),
    answer("cell cycle"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Finding Orthologs

```{r huntingtons-lab-orthologs}
quiz(caption = "Investigate orthologs for the *lab* gene",
  question("What is the most likely human ortholog for the *lab* gene?",
    answer("HTT"),
    answer("HOXA", correct = TRUE),
    answer("HSAP"),
    answer("LAT"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("How many programs think this gene is an ortholog of *lab*?",
    answer("1"),
    answer("4"),
    answer("7", correct = TRUE),
    answer("11"),
    answer("15"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Disease models

Because disease models are of particular interest, there is a special section in the FlyBase gene report about relationships between that FlyBase gene and any human diseases.  Note that there are 3 types of relationships that are reported:

- **Models Based on Experimental Evidence**: someone has studied flies with disruptions to this gene and has shown that the flies have similar symptoms to humans
- **Potential Models Based on Orthology**: we think this gene could be used to study a particular disease because we think it’s an ortholog, but we don’t have proof.
- **Modifiers Based on Experimental Evidence**: this gene doesn’t directly cause a disease, but makes a disease caused by a different gene better or worse

### Disease report for the *Ace* gene

The *Ace* gene has no known or predicted relationship to any human diseases, so its report is pretty boring in this section:

### Huntington’s Disease

Let’s take a look at something more interesting.  Say we've heard that scientists are using fruit flies to study Huntington’s disease.  Can we use FlyBase to find out more?

FlyBase has lots of information besides just reports about specific genes.  If you go to the FlyBase homepage and scroll down to the Quick Search box, you can see some of the categories of information available.  Let’s search for the Huntington’s disease model:

1. Go to the FlyBase homepage
1. In the Quick Search box, select "Human Disease"
1. Enter "Huntington’s disease"

This will give you a list of everything related to Huntington’s disease on FlyBase:

![FlyBase search results for Huntington's disease](images/FlyBase_search_Huntingtons.png){width=100%}


At the top we see:
The **Human Disease Model** report - information about models for this disease
The **Disease Ontology** report - information from a database about human diseases
The **Gene Report** for the human (*Homo sapiens*) gene: Hsap/HTT
The **Gene Report** for the *Drosophila* homolog: Dmel/htt

The Human Disease Model report is a good place to start.  Clicking on this result takes us to the [full report](https://flybase.org/reports/FBhh0000003).

At the top we can see some information about the disease, including a brief overview of the disease and a link to the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database entry for the disease:

![FlyBase Human Disease Model report for Huntington's disease](images/FlyBase_Huntingtons.png){width=100%}


Further down the page, there is a section describing the relevant *Drosophila* gene(s):

![Drosophila gene information from the Human Disease Model report for Huntington's disease](images/FlyBase_Huntingtons_Drosophila_genes.png){width=100%}

```{r huntingtons-quiz-1}
quiz(caption = "Explore the Huntington's disease report",
  question("What is the gene symbol for the Drosophila ortholog of the human Huntington's disease gene?",
    answer("hunt"),
    answer("HD"),
    answer("htt", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Dmel"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

### Investigate the *htt* gene

Now that we know the *htt* gene is used to model Huntington’s disease, let’s find out more about this gene.  Look up the Gene report for this gene.  The easiest way to do this is to type "htt" in the Jump to Gene box.

```{r huntingtons-quiz-2}
quiz(caption = "Explore the *htt* gene report",
  question("What biological processes is the *htt* gene involved in? HINT: Choose more than one answer.",
    answer("brain development"),
    answer("choline catabolic process"),
    answer("establishment of mitotic spindle orientation", correct = TRUE),
    answer("synaptic vesicle transport", correct = TRUE),
    answer("cell cycle"),
    answer("axo-dendritic transport", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("How many different *alleles* (versions of the gene) can be used as models of Huntington's disease, **based on experimental evidence**?",
    answer("0"),
    answer("1"),
    answer("2"),
    answer("3", correct = TRUE),
    answer("4"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

### *htt* alleles (variant forms of the gene)

Yes!  Here we can see that there are actually three different variants of the *htt* gene that have been experimentally shown to cause symptoms similar to Huntington’s disease in flies.  These variants all have different types of mutations affecting the *htt* gene.

It can be useful to have different versions of the gene that all mimic Huntington's disease.  Depending how these mutations were made or discovered, they can be useful for different types of experiments.  Also, if experiments turn out the same for several different disease-causing mutations, it's more likely that the result will transfer to other organisms, and isn't just a quirk of a particular mutation.

## Summary

FlyBase is a fantastic source of information.  You can use FlyBase to find:

- Gene functions and interactions
- Orthologs (*Drosophila* genes that are related to genes in other species, including humans)
- *Drosophila* genes that are relevant to human diseases
- The name, symbol or ID number for a gene, so you can research it on other databases.
