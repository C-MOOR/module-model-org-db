## Summary

- Model organisms allow scientists to conduct many experiments faster, cheaper, and easier than could be done in humans.
- Model organisms allow us to conduct experiments that would be unethical or impossible in humans.
- A common strategy is to start by doing many experiments in a simple organism (like yeast), and then follow up on the most promising results in more complex organisms, including humans.
- Some of the most common model organisms are:
  - Mouse (*Mus musculus*)
  - Fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*)
  - Yeast (*Saccharomyces cerevisiae*)
  - E. coli (*Escherichia coli*, a type of bacteria)
