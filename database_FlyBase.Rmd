#### Learning Goals {-}

- Use FlyBase to look up information about genes by name, gene symbol, or FlyBase ID number
- Use FlyBase to find fruit fly models of human disease

### What is FlyBase?

FlyBase ([flybase.org](http://flybase.org)) is a website for the *Drosophila* scientific community that organizes research results about *Drosophila*.  We can use it to find out what has been discovered about genes we're interested in.

There are many species of *Drosophila*.  Most research is done using *Drosophila melanogaster* (abbreviated Dmel), but FlyBase also has information about other species of flies.

### FlyBase Gene Pages

One important role for FlyBase is keeping track of all the *Drosophila* genes and what we know about them.  FlyBase maintains a webpage for each known *Drosophila* gene.

#### FlyBase ID {-}

Every gene on FlyBase has a **FlyBase ID** number that looks like this: `FBgnXXXXXXX`, with the X's being different numbers.  FB stands for FlyBase and gn stands for gene.  There are ~17000 *Drosophila melanogaster* genes.  Each known *Drosophila* gene has its own FlyBase ID, and you can use the FlyBase ID to find information about the genes such as what they do and whether they are related to any human genes.

#### Look up a gene on FlyBase {-}

You can look up a gene on FlyBase using the "Jump to Gene" search box.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase homepage, showing buttons linking out to various tools.  The searchbox labeled 'Jump to Gene' is circled.", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase homepage https://flybase.org/.

### Exercise {- .unlisted}
Go to FlyBase, and enter `FBgn0000024` in the search bar ("Jump to Gene").
:::

This page has a ton of useful information for finding out more about this gene!  We'll highlight a few important things to start with:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase page for the Ace gene.  The page contains a table of information about the gene, and two areas of the page are circled.  The first circle encompasses, the Symbol, which is 'Dmel\Ace' and and the Name, which is 'Acetylcholine esterase'. The second circle encompasses the Gene Snapshot, which says 'Acetylcholine esterase (Ace) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to acetate and choline, thus resetting the neurotransmission mechanism at neuromuscular junctions.'.", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase gene page for Ace https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000024. License: [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)"}

```

+ The gene **Symbol** and **Name**.  Genes are usually named after what they do, and their symbol is a usually shortened version of the name.  In this case, gene `FBgn0000024` is named Acetylcholine esterase, and is abbreviated *Ace*.  (The Dmel stands for *Drosophila melanogaster*.)
+ The **Gene Snapshot** gives a quick summary of what we know about this gene.  In this case, it's an enzyme involved in neurotransmission.
