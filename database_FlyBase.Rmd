#### Learning Goals {-}

- Use FlyBase to look up information about genes by name, gene symbol, or FlyBase ID number
- Use FlyBase to find fruit fly models of human disease

### What is FlyBase?

FlyBase ([flybase.org](http://flybase.org)) is a website for the *Drosophila* scientific community that organizes research results about *Drosophila*.  We can use it to find out what has been discovered about genes we're interested in.

There are many species of *Drosophila*.  Most research is done using *Drosophila melanogaster* (abbreviated Dmel), but FlyBase also has information about other species of flies.

### FlyBase Gene Pages

One important role for FlyBase is keeping track of all the *Drosophila* genes and what we know about them.  FlyBase maintains a webpage for each known *Drosophila* gene.

#### FlyBase ID {-}

Every gene on FlyBase has a **FlyBase ID** number that looks like this: `FBgnXXXXXXX`, with the X's being different numbers.  FB stands for FlyBase and gn stands for gene.  There are ~17000 *Drosophila melanogaster* genes.  Each known *Drosophila* gene has its own FlyBase ID, and you can use the FlyBase ID to find information about the genes such as what they do and whether they are related to any human genes.

#### Look up a gene on FlyBase {-}

You can look up a gene on FlyBase using the "Jump to Gene" search box.

Go to FlyBase, and enter `FBgn0000024` in the search bar ("Jump to Gene").
:::

This page has a ton of useful information for finding out more about this gene!  We'll highlight a few important things to start with:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase page for the Ace gene.  The page contains a table of information about the gene, and two areas of the page are circled.  The first circle encompasses, the Symbol, which is 'Dmel\\Ace' and and the Name, which is 'Acetylcholine esterase'. The second circle encompasses the Gene Snapshot, which says 'Acetylcholine esterase (Ace) encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to acetate and choline, thus resetting the neurotransmission mechanism at neuromuscular junctions.'.", fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase gene page for Ace https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000024. License: [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)"}

knitr::include_graphics("assets/database_FlyBase/FlyBase_Ace_summary.png")
```

+ The gene **Symbol** and **Name**.  Genes are usually named after what they do, and their symbol is a usually shortened version of the name.  In this case, gene `FBgn0000024` is named Acetylcholine esterase, and is abbreviated *Ace*.  (The Dmel stands for *Drosophila melanogaster*.)
+ The **Gene Snapshot** gives a quick summary of what we know about this gene.  In this case, it's an enzyme involved in neurotransmission.

#### Gene Ontology

Further down the page are the **Gene Ontology** or **GO** terms.  There are 3 categories of GO terms:

+ **Molecular Function**: What does this gene do at a molecular level?  How does it interact with other molecules? (Examples: enzyme - catalyzes a reaction, DNA binding - binds to DNA, transporter - moves something across a membrane)
+ **Biological Process**: What does this gene do for the organism?  What's the "big picture"? (Examples: involved in development, reproduction, immune system, etc.)
+ **Cellular Component**: Where in a cell is the gene found?  (Examples: the nucleus, mitochondria, cell membrane, etc.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Screenshot of the Gene Ontology section of the Flybase gene page for Ace'.  The Gene Ontology table has three columns.  The first column, labeled 'CV Term' lists the Gene Ontology term.  The second column, labeled 'Evidence' gives a brief description of the evidence, for example 'inferred from mutant phenotype'.  The final column, labeled 'References' contains links to scientific papers." fig.cap = "Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the Gene Ontology section of the FlyBase gene page for Ace https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000024#function. License: [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)"}

```

For the *Ace* gene, we can see its **molecular functions** include acetylcholinesterase activity (it's an enzyme).  You can click on these terms to find out more about them.  For example, if you click on "acetylcholinesterase activity" you can find out more about the reaction that is being catalyzed, and find other genes that carry out this same reaction.

You can also see from this table how we know this information - it tells you what kind of evidence we have to prove it, and it links to the paper where that evidence came from.

#### Other information

This page contains a lot of other information, including any known interactions of this gene with other genes, information about similar genes in other organisms (orthologs), and whether related genes are relevant to any human diseases (we will discuss how to explore these in the next section).  As you investigate *Drosophila* data and find genes that you want to learn more about, FlyBase is a good place to start.
