#### Learning Goals {-}

- Use FlyBase to look up information about genes by name, gene symbol, or FlyBase ID number
- Use FlyBase to find fruit fly models of human disease

FlyBase ([flybase.org](http://flybase.org)) is a website for the *Drosophila* scientific community that organizes research results about *Drosophila*.  We can use it to find out what has been discovered about genes we're interested in.

There are many species of *Drosophila*.  Most research is done using *Drosophila melanogaster* (abbreviated Dmel), but FlyBase also has information about other species of flies.
