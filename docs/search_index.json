Some of the most important genetic model organisms in use today.

Name 4 commonly used model organisms Compare and contrast the pros and cons of different model organisms 1.1.1 What is a model organism? Scientists who study biology often choose to focus their work on a few specific organisms. These are called model organisms, because they are being used as a “model” for biological processes occurring in many species. This works because many biological processes are conserved - they work the same way in many different organisms. Coordinating our experiments in the same organisms has many advantages: We can easily compare results and build off of each other’s work Tools and techniques developed in one lab can be used by many other researchers We build up a strong understanding of those organisms, which makes it easier to understand new results. Besides studying basic biology, model organisms can also be useful for learning more about humans and human diseases. There are many questions we would like to answer for which we can’t conduct human experiments, either for ethical reasons, or just because it is too difficult. It’s often much faster, cheaper, and easier to conduct experiments in model organisms. A common strategy is to start by doing many experiments in a simple organism (like yeast), and then follow up on the most promising results in more complex organisms. Models of Huntington’s disease In the following video, you will hear about how researchers are using yeast and fruit flies as model organisms to study Huntington’s disease. 1.1.2 What makes a good model organism? Some of the most common model organisms are: Mouse (Mus musculus) Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) E. coli (Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria) These organisms were chosen for a combination of practical and historical reasons They have useful properties that makes it easy to do experiments (for example, short generation times make genetic experiments easier) Important discoveries were made with them, and scientists continued to work with them to follow up on those discoveries The more a model organism is studied, the more useful it becomes for future research. New tools and techniques are developed, so there are more options for carrying out experiments As we learn more about an organism, it becomes easier to interpret new results. It’s a lot easier to understand how a particular mutation might be causing problems if we already know a lot about the gene the mutation was found in. 1.1.3 Choosing a model organism Obviously, the most accurate way to learn about humans is to study humans, but this is not always the best option. In fact, it can often be more efficient to conduct experiments in simpler organisms - they are smaller, easier to care for, and have shorter generation times, so we can do a lot more experiments. Then, as we come to have a better understanding of our particular question, we can investigate the nuances in more complex organisms. Generally the more complex and more similar an organism is to a human, the more confident we can be that the results of an experiment will apply to humans as well. But, there are other important considerations: Ethical concerns: More complex organisms require more care and consideration for their treatment. We take care to avoid causing unnecessary distress, and evaluate whether a study can be conducted effectively with less complex organisms. Expense: More complex organisms are more expensive to care for and tend to reproduce more slowly and in smaller quantities. With limited time and resources we need to think about how to efficiently obtain the information we are seeking. Available tools and techniques: Some organisms are easier to work with than others for particular types of experiments. Yeast are great for genetics - it’s easy to edit their genome. Fruit flies are similarly useful for genetics - they aren’t as easy as yeast, but they are the easiest multicellular model organism to work with for genetic experiments. Zebrafish embryos are transparent, so they are particularly good for microscopy experiments. 1.1.4 Common model organisms Mouse Ilmari Karonen (2006) Common house mouse (Mus musculus), wild type. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mouse_white_background.jpg Public Domain Genome ~3 billion bases in length (similar to human) ~25,000 genes &gt; 99% of human genes have homologs in mice Reproduction Generation time: ~10 weeks Usually 6-8 offspring per generation (range ~3-14) How long to get 1000 offspring? ~ 6-8 months Fruit fly Sanjay Acharya (2017) A fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) feeding off a banana. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drosophila_melanogaster_Proboscis.jpg License: CC BY 4.0 Genome ~140 million bases in length ~17,000 genes ~ 60% of human genes have orthologs in flies Reproduction Generation time: ~2 weeks Hundreds of offspring per generation How long to get 1000 offspring? ~ 1 month Yeast Rainis Venta (2011) Drop-inoculation of laboratory baker´s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutants on agar plate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae#/media/File:Laboratoorne_pagarip%C3%A4rm_(Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)_agariplaadil..JPG License: CC BY-SA 3.0 Genome ~12 million bases in length ~6,000 genes ~ 23 of yeast genes have homologs in humans Reproduction Generation time: ~2 hours 1 offspring per reproduction (“budding”) How long to get 1000 offspring? 1 day E. coli Madprime (2007) K12 E. coli colonies on a plate. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ecoli_colonies.png License: CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication Genome ~5 million bases in length ~4,000 genes E. coli are quite different from humans (much more so than yeast - yeast are still eukaryotes like humans, but E. coli are bacteria). E. coli aren’t really used to study the functions of human proteins or their orthologs in a living organism, the way yeast are. But they are very useful for mass-producing copies of a human protein if we want to study it in the lab (for example, measure the activity of an enzyme under different conditions, or try to figure out the structure of a particular protein). Reproduction Generation time: ~20 minutes 1 offspring per reproduction (“binary fission”) How long to get 1000 offspring? 4 hours Other organisms Many other organisms have been used as model organisms, though they are less common. They may be more difficult to work with, be less well studied, or not have as many tools and techniques available, and therefore tend to be used for particular types of experiments where they are particularly well suited. Some examples include: Non-human primates can be used when we need to get as close as possible to human biology. Primates are highly intelligent (presenting ethical concerns) are expensive to care for, and have slow generation times, so they are typically only used when there is a strong need for a closer similarity to humans than we can get with other organisms. Rats (Rattus norvegicus) are sometimes used as an alternative to mice. They are larger (making them more expensive to care for, but also easier to handle) and more intelligent, which can be useful for some types of experiments. For some diseases, rat models are more similar to humans than mouse models are. Frogs (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis) eggs and oocytes are quite large and the embryos develop externally, making them relatively easy to manipulate. This makes them a good model for early vertebrate development, as well as basic cell and molecular biology. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are similarly useful for studying early development, as their eggs are fertilized externally (easy to manipulate). They are particularly useful for microscopy studies, as the embryos are transparent. Worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) are also useful for studying development. They are transparent throughout their lives, and have small enough body plan that we can keep track of every single cell. 1.1.5 Summary Model organisms allow scientists to conduct many experiments faster, cheaper, and easier than could be done in humans. Model organisms allow us to conduct experiments that would be unethical or impossible in humans. A common strategy is to start by doing many experiments in a simple organism (like yeast), and then follow up on the most promising results in more complex organisms, including humans. Some of the most common model organisms are: Mouse (Mus musculus) Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) E. coli (Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria) "],["drosophila-melanogaster-fruit-fly.html", "1.2 Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)", " 1.2 Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) Figure 1.1: Sanjay Acharya (2017) A fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) feeding off a banana. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drosophila_melanogaster_Proboscis.jpg License: CC BY 4.0 Learning Goals Provide 3 reasons why fruit flies are useful for scientific research List 3 ways in which fruit flies are similar to humans Compare and contrast the fruit fly genome to the human genome Briefly describe the fruit fly life cycle 1.2.1 Why fruit flies? At first glance, fruit flies don’t look anything like humans. But at a deep level, we share many anatomical structures, physiological systems, and developmental patterns. Many Drosophila genes have parallels (“orthologs”) in humans that perform similar functions. Studying fruit flies can give important insights into basic biological processes that are shared across many organisms. Discoveries made in fruit flies have made important contributions to our understanding of genetics, development, aging, immunology, and neuroscience, to name just a few. Fruit fly research is also being used to investigate many diseases, including Huntington’s disease, epilepsy, obesity, and Alzheimer’s. The following video highlights some of the reasons fruit flies make such great model organisms, and discusses an example of how a gene first discovered studied in fruit flies turned out to have an important role in polydactyly (having extra fingers or toes) and cancer. 1.2.2 Meet Drosophila melanogaster Anatomy and Physiology Almost every organ in humans has a match in flies, and the genes that control their development and functions are often shared across species. Figure 1.2: Prokop, Andreas; Patel, Sanjai (2018): Biology lessons for schools using the fruit fly Drosophila. figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1352064.v31 License: CC BY 4.0 Eyes - While Drosophila eyes are quite different from humans (Drosophila have compound eyes), the same genes that control development of fly eyes are involved in eye development in many species including frogs, mice, and humans. Nervous system - The central nervous systems of Drosophila and humans have a similar subdivision into a brain and spinal cord (ventral cord in Drosophila). The nerve cells of Drosophila are quite similar to humans and many of the same genes are involved in their function. Heart - The structure of the Drosophila heart is different from a human, but they use the same mechanisms to control their heartbeats. Both human and Drosophila heart cells have electrical properties that allow them to operate without being stimulated by the nervous system, and they both have pacemaker cells to regulate their heartbeat. Digestive system - The digestive systems of Drosophila and humans have similar organizations with regions that perform similar functions. First is the esophagus, which carries food to the crop (stomach in humans) where it is broken down. Then the midgut (small intestine), and hindgut (large intestine) are responsible for absorbing the food so it can be used by the rest of the body. Reproductive tract - Like humans, Drosophila have testes which produce sperm and ovaries which produce eggs. Genetics The Drosophila genome: About 140 million bases in length ~17,000 genes About 60 percent of all human genes have orthologs in flies (retain the same function and came from a common ancestor) About 75 percent of human disease-associated genes have orthologs in flies 4 pairs of chromosomes: 3 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) 1 pair of sex chromosomes. Like humans, females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y chromosome. There are many genetic tools and techniques available for Drosophila; here are just a few: P-element transformation - a technique that allows researchers to insert genes in the Drosophila genome GAL4/UAS expression - a technique that allows researchers to control expression of a gene, “turning on” the gene in a specific tissue or under specific conditions Mutation libraries - collections of fly strains where each strain has a mutation in a different gene Life Cycle Figure 1.3: Life‐cycle of Drosophila from Farzana Khan Perveen (February 28th 2018). Introduction to Drosophila, Drosophila melanogaster - Model for Recent Advances in Genetics and Therapeutics, Farzana Khan Perveen, IntechOpen, DOI: 10.5772/67731. Available from: https://www.intechopen.com/books/drosophila-melanogaster-model-for-recent-advances-in-genetics-and-therapeutics/introduction-to-drosophila License: CC BY 3.0 The Drosophila life cycle has 4 stages: Egg - Female Drosophila can lay hundreds of eggs! When living in a vial, they will lay their eggs on the surface of the food. Larva - Larva look like worms. When flies are living in a vial, you can see larvae at the bottom, crawling around on the surface of the food, and even burrowing into the food. Pupa - A larva constructs a hard shell around itself. It will emerge a couple of days later as an adult fly (similar to a butterfly). When flies are living in a vial, the larvae will crawl up and attach themselves to the sides of the vial before forming pupae. Adult - the familiar fruit fly. When flies are living in a vial, the adults will flit around the vial, eating food from the bottom, flying around the top, and resting on the sides of the vial. Flies are attracted to light, so if there is a directional light source, they will move towards it. Under optimal conditions, the complete life cycle takes about 10 days. With lower temperatures, less available food, or other unfavorable conditions the generation time will be longer. 1.2.3 Working with Drosophila So far we’ve talked about some of the advantages and characteristics of Drosophila as a model organism. But what does it look like to actually work with Drosophila in the lab? Here are a couple of videos demonstrating some day-to-day procedures in a fruit fly lab. “Fly flipping” This video shows one of the most common tasks for fly maintenance - transferring flies to a fresh vial of food. This is sometimes called “fly flipping” because it involves sliding the new vial over the old one and then flipping the vials over so the flies end up in the new vial. Notice how she taps the vials on the lab bench to shake the flies down to the bottom of the vial before removing the stopper - this helps prevent the flies from escaping as she makes the transfer. Dissection For many experiments, the fruit flies must be dissected in order to obtain the tissues we’re interested in studying. The tissues might then be viewed under a high-power microscope, or have their DNA or RNA sequenced. Dissecting a fruit fly is challenging, because it is so small! Scientists use special tweezers with very thin tips (“fine forceps”) to manipulate the flies. A dissecting microscope helps them see what they’re doing. Carbon dioxide or ether is used to anesthetize the flies before the procedure. The following video shows dissection of the reproductive tracts from Drosophila. Similar processes can be used to collect other tissues, such as the gut or brain. Don’t worry too much about the names for all the different organs mentioned in the video. Focus on the overall procedure, and think about how this process of dissection is an essential part of many experiments. 1.2.4 Drosophila disease models There are hundreds of disease models that have been generated in Drosophila - you can see a list on the FlyBase Disease Model page. Figure 1.4: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the FlyBase Disease model page https://flybase.org/lists/FBhh/. License: CC BY 4.0 There is even a blog to help keep track of Drosophila disease model developments. Many of these disease models are available through Drosophila Stock Centers - organizations that maintain collections of fly “strains” (distinct genotypes) and distribute them to researchers. When a researcher develops a new fly strain, they can submit it to a stock center so that other researchers can use it. 1.2.5 Summary Fruit flies share many commonalities with humans including organs and organ systems, anatomical organization, and genes. About 60 percent of all human genes, and about 75 percent of human disease-associated genes have orthologs in flies Fruit flies have a short generation time, produce many offspring, and are easy to work with in the lab. You can do lots of experiments without needing too much time or money. Many important discoveries have been made using fruit flies Fruit flies are used today for many types of research, from development to disease. Many human diseases can be modeled and studied in fruit flies. "],["lab-lecture-what-is-a-gene.html", "Chapter 2 Lab Lecture: What is a Gene?", " Chapter 2 Lab Lecture: What is a Gene?
