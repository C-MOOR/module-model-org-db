Right: Logos from several biological databases Audience and Prerequisites This module is designed for introductory biology courses. Key ideas center around genes and homologs, and the proteins they encode. We typically include this module as part of a Molecular Biology unit. Prerequisites: Basic understanding of genes and homology The project portion of the module involves looking up genes in different databases (human and model organism). Students should have a basic understanding of what a gene is (and why we care about them), and why it makes sense to study similar genes (i.e. homologs) across different organisms. This module will help solidify these concepts by having students investigate concrete examples of genes and their homologs.

We have primarily used it as a single lab period, but have also used it as a flipped-classroom activity in a lecture course, assigning portions as homework and completing the Database Project portion in class. The Example Lab portion of this book demonstrates how we typically organize the material for a single lab period of an introductory biology course. How to Use this Book This book is organized into two parts: The Example Lab demonstrates how we have used the material as a single lab period of an introductory biology course. The “chapters” of the Example Lab are the instructions that we give to our students, and can be downloaded as .docx files if you want to modify them for your course, or can be assigned directly if you are happy with them as-is. These assignments direct students to work through one or more of the chapters in our Content Collection. The Content Collection contains standalone readings and activities on specific topics, similar to textbook chapters. In the future we intend to incorporate additional Content chapters covering other model organisms and databases, so that instructors can choose the organisms and databases most relevant to their students. Customizing Assignments Each of the assignment chapters in the Example Lab includes a link to a .docx version of the assignment (in the Footnotes) so that you can easily make your own copy and adapt it to your needs. If you are comfortable with GitHub, you can also fork the repository for this book and modify the R Markdown files.

Learning Objectives Name two biological databases and briefly describe the types of information they each contain. Use online databases to look up information about a gene. Introduction Scientists often use online databases to store and share their research. These biological databases make vast amounts of scientific research freely available to anyone, as long as you know where to look. The first activity will introduce you to a few of these databases by teaching you where to find them and what kinds of information they contain. FlyBase is a database for everything there is to know about fruit flies and their genetics. The second activity will teach you how to find and learn about fruit fly genes on FlyBase, and how to find out which fruit fly genes correspond to which human genes. The Human Protein Atlas contains information about human proteins and where they are located in the body. The third activity will show you how to use the Human Protein Atlas to discover what tissues a protein is expressed in, as well as its subcellular localization (where in a cell the protein is located). Knowing the location of a protein can help us figure out what it does. Activity 1 - Databases Estimated time: 10 min Instructions Click here to open the Biological Databases Introduction.

Name 4 commonly used model organisms Compare and contrast the pros and cons of different model organisms 5.1.1 What is a model organism? Scientists who study biology often choose to focus their work on a few specific organisms. These are called model organisms, because they are being used as a “model” for biological processes occurring in many species. This works because many biological processes are conserved - they work the same way in many different organisms. Coordinating our experiments in the same organisms has many advantages: We can easily compare results and build off of each other’s work Tools and techniques developed in one lab can be used by many other researchers We build up a strong understanding of those organisms, which makes it easier to understand new results. Besides studying basic biology, model organisms can also be useful for learning more about humans and human diseases. There are many questions we would like to answer for which we can’t conduct human experiments, either for ethical reasons, or just because it is too difficult. It’s often much faster, cheaper, and easier to conduct experiments in model organisms. A common strategy is to start by doing many experiments in a simple organism (like yeast), and then follow up on the most promising results in more complex organisms. Models of Huntington’s disease In the following video, you will hear about how researchers are using yeast and fruit flies as model organisms to study Huntington’s disease. 5.1.2 What makes a good model organism? Some of the most common model organisms are: Mouse (Mus musculus) Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) E. coli (Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria) These organisms were chosen for a combination of practical and historical reasons They have useful properties that makes it easy to do experiments (for example, short generation times make genetic experiments easier) Important discoveries were made with them, and scientists continued to work with them to follow up on those discoveries The more a model organism is studied, the more useful it becomes for future research. New tools and techniques are developed, so there are more options for carrying out experiments As we learn more about an organism, it becomes easier to interpret new results. It’s a lot easier to understand how a particular mutation might be causing problems if we already know a lot about the gene the mutation was found in. 5.1.3 Choosing a model organism Obviously, the most accurate way to learn about humans is to study humans, but this is not always the best option. In fact, it can often be more efficient to conduct experiments in simpler organisms - they are smaller, easier to care for, and have shorter generation times, so we can do a lot more experiments. Then, as we come to have a better understanding of our particular question, we can investigate the nuances in more complex organisms. Generally the more complex and more similar an organism is to a human, the more confident we can be that the results of an experiment will apply to humans as well. But, there are other important considerations: Ethical concerns: More complex organisms require more care and consideration for their treatment. We take care to avoid causing unnecessary distress, and evaluate whether a study can be conducted effectively with less complex organisms. Expense: More complex organisms are more expensive to care for and tend to reproduce more slowly and in smaller quantities. With limited time and resources we need to think about how to efficiently obtain the information we are seeking. Available tools and techniques: Some organisms are easier to work with than others for particular types of experiments. Yeast are great for genetics - it’s easy to edit their genome. Fruit flies are similarly useful for genetics - they aren’t as easy as yeast, but they are the easiest multicellular model organism to work with for genetic experiments. Zebrafish embryos are transparent, so they are particularly good for microscopy experiments. 5.1.4 Common model organisms Mouse Figure 5.1: Ilmari Karonen (2006) Common house mouse (Mus musculus), wild type. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mouse_white_background.jpg License: Public Domain Genome ~3 billion bases in length (similar to human) ~25,000 genes &gt; 99% of human genes have homologs in mice Reproduction Generation time: ~10 weeks Usually 6-8 offspring per generation (range ~3-14) How long to get 1000 offspring? ~ 6-8 months Fruit fly Figure 5.2: Sanjay Acharya (2017) A fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) feeding off a banana. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drosophila_melanogaster_Proboscis.jpg License: CC BY 4.0 Genome ~140 million bases in length ~17,000 genes ~ 60% of human genes have orthologs in flies Reproduction Generation time: ~2 weeks Hundreds of offspring per generation How long to get 1000 offspring? ~ 1 month Yeast Figure 5.3: Rainis Venta (2011) Drop-inoculation of laboratory baker´s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutants on agar plate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae#/media/File:Laboratoorne_pagarip%C3%A4rm_(Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)_agariplaadil..JPG License: CC BY-SA 3.0 Genome ~12 million bases in length ~6,000 genes ~ 23 of yeast genes have homologs in humans Reproduction Generation time: ~2 hours 1 offspring per reproduction (“budding”) How long to get 1000 offspring? 1 day E. coli Figure 5.4: Madprime (2007) K12 E. coli colonies on a plate. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ecoli_colonies.png License: CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication Genome ~5 million bases in length ~4,000 genes E. coli are quite different from humans (much more so than yeast - yeast are still eukaryotes like humans, but E. coli are bacteria). E. coli aren’t really used to study the functions of human proteins or their orthologs in a living organism, the way yeast are. But they are very useful for mass-producing copies of a human protein if we want to study it in the lab (for example, measure the activity of an enzyme under different conditions, or try to figure out the structure of a particular protein). Reproduction Generation time: ~20 minutes 1 offspring per reproduction (“binary fission”) How long to get 1000 offspring? 4 hours Other organisms Many other organisms have been used as model organisms, though they are less common. They may be more difficult to work with, be less well studied, or not have as many tools and techniques available, and therefore tend to be used for particular types of experiments where they are particularly well suited. Some examples include: Non-human primates can be used when we need to get as close as possible to human biology. Primates are highly intelligent (presenting ethical concerns) are expensive to care for, and have slow generation times, so they are typically only used when there is a strong need for a closer similarity to humans than we can get with other organisms. Rats (Rattus norvegicus) are sometimes used as an alternative to mice. They are larger (making them more expensive to care for, but also easier to handle) and more intelligent, which can be useful for some types of experiments. For some diseases, rat models are more similar to humans than mouse models are. Frogs (Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis) eggs and oocytes are quite large and the embryos develop externally, making them relatively easy to manipulate. This makes them a good model for early vertebrate development, as well as basic cell and molecular biology. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are similarly useful for studying early development, as their eggs are fertilized externally (easy to manipulate). They are particularly useful for microscopy studies, as the embryos are transparent. Worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) are also useful for studying development. They are transparent throughout their lives, and have small enough body plan that we can keep track of every single cell. 5.1.5 Summary Model organisms allow scientists to conduct many experiments faster, cheaper, and easier than could be done in humans. Model organisms allow us to conduct experiments that would be unethical or impossible in humans. A common strategy is to start by doing many experiments in a simple organism (like yeast), and then follow up on the most promising results in more complex organisms, including humans. Some of the most common model organisms are: Mouse (Mus musculus) Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) E. coli (Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria) "],["model-org-drosophila.html", "5.2 Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)", " 5.2 Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) Figure 0.1: Sanjay Acharya (2017) A fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) feeding off a banana. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Drosophila_melanogaster_Proboscis.jpg License: CC BY 4.0 Learning Objectives Provide 3 reasons why fruit flies are useful for scientific research List 3 ways in which fruit flies are similar to humans Compare and contrast the fruit fly genome to the human genome Briefly describe the fruit fly life cycle 5.2.1 Why fruit flies? At first glance, fruit flies don’t look anything like humans. But at a deep level, we share many anatomical structures, physiological systems, and developmental patterns. Many Drosophila genes have parallels (“orthologs”) in humans that perform similar functions. Studying fruit flies can give important insights into basic biological processes that are shared across many organisms. Discoveries made in fruit flies have made important contributions to our understanding of genetics, development, aging, immunology, and neuroscience, to name just a few. Fruit fly research is also being used to investigate many diseases, including Huntington’s disease, epilepsy, obesity, and Alzheimer’s. The following video highlights some of the reasons fruit flies make such great model organisms, and discusses an example of how a gene first discovered studied in fruit flies turned out to have an important role in polydactyly (having extra fingers or toes) and cancer. 5.2.2 Meet Drosophila melanogaster Anatomy and Physiology Almost every organ in humans has a match in flies, and the genes that control their development and functions are often shared across species. Figure 5.1: Prokop, Andreas; Patel, Sanjai (2018): Biology lessons for schools using the fruit fly Drosophila. figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1352064.v31 License: CC BY 4.0 Eyes - While Drosophila eyes are quite different from humans (Drosophila have compound eyes), the same genes that control development of fly eyes are involved in eye development in many species including frogs, mice, and humans. Nervous system - The central nervous systems of Drosophila and humans have a similar subdivision into a brain and spinal cord (ventral cord in Drosophila). The nerve cells of Drosophila are quite similar to humans and many of the same genes are involved in their function. Heart - The structure of the Drosophila heart is different from a human, but they use the same mechanisms to control their heartbeats. Both human and Drosophila heart cells have electrical properties that allow them to operate without being stimulated by the nervous system, and they both have pacemaker cells to regulate their heartbeat. Digestive system - The digestive systems of Drosophila and humans have similar organizations with regions that perform similar functions. First is the esophagus, which carries food to the crop (stomach in humans) where it is broken down. Then the midgut (small intestine), and hindgut (large intestine) are responsible for absorbing the food so it can be used by the rest of the body. Reproductive tract - Like humans, Drosophila have testes which produce sperm and ovaries which produce eggs. Genetics The Drosophila genome: About 140 million bases in length ~17,000 genes About 60 percent of all human genes have orthologs in flies (retain the same function and came from a common ancestor) About 75 percent of human disease-associated genes have orthologs in flies 4 pairs of chromosomes: 3 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) 1 pair of sex chromosomes. Like humans, females have two X chromosomes, and males have an X and a Y chromosome. There are many genetic tools and techniques available for Drosophila; here are just a few: P-element transformation - a technique that allows researchers to insert genes in the Drosophila genome GAL4/UAS expression - a technique that allows researchers to control expression of a gene, “turning on” the gene in a specific tissue or under specific conditions Mutation libraries - collections of fly strains where each strain has a mutation in a different gene Life Cycle Figure 5.2: Life‐cycle of Drosophila from Farzana Khan Perveen (February 28th 2018). Introduction to Drosophila, Drosophila melanogaster - Model for Recent Advances in Genetics and Therapeutics, Farzana Khan Perveen, IntechOpen, DOI: 10.5772/67731. Available from: https://www.intechopen.com/books/drosophila-melanogaster-model-for-recent-advances-in-genetics-and-therapeutics/introduction-to-drosophila License: CC BY 3.0 The Drosophila life cycle has 4 stages: Egg - Female Drosophila can lay hundreds of eggs! When living in a vial, they will lay their eggs on the surface of the food. Larva - Larva look like worms. When flies are living in a vial, you can see larvae at the bottom, crawling around on the surface of the food, and even burrowing into the food. Pupa - A larva constructs a hard shell around itself. It will emerge a couple of days later as an adult fly (similar to a butterfly). When flies are living in a vial, the larvae will crawl up and attach themselves to the sides of the vial before forming pupae. Adult - the familiar fruit fly. When flies are living in a vial, the adults will flit around the vial, eating food from the bottom, flying around the top, and resting on the sides of the vial. Flies are attracted to light, so if there is a directional light source, they will move towards it. Under optimal conditions, the complete life cycle takes about 10 days. With lower temperatures, less available food, or other unfavorable conditions the generation time will be longer. 5.2.3 Working with Drosophila So far we’ve talked about some of the advantages and characteristics of Drosophila as a model organism. But what does it look like to actually work with Drosophila in the lab? Here are a couple of videos demonstrating some day-to-day procedures in a fruit fly lab. “Fly flipping” This video shows one of the most common tasks for fly maintenance - transferring flies to a fresh vial of food. This is sometimes called “fly flipping” because it involves sliding the new vial over the old one and then flipping the vials over so the flies end up in the new vial. Notice how she taps the vials on the lab bench to shake the flies down to the bottom of the vial before removing the stopper - this helps prevent the flies from escaping as she makes the transfer. Dissection For many experiments, the fruit flies must be dissected in order to obtain the tissues we’re interested in studying. The tissues might then be viewed under a high-power microscope, or have their DNA or RNA sequenced. Dissecting a fruit fly is challenging, because it is so small! Scientists use special tweezers with very thin tips (“fine forceps”) to manipulate the flies. A dissecting microscope helps them see what they’re doing. Carbon dioxide or ether is used to anesthetize the flies before the procedure. The following video shows dissection of the reproductive tracts from Drosophila. Similar processes can be used to collect other tissues, such as the gut or brain. Don’t worry too much about the names for all the different organs mentioned in the video. Focus on the overall procedure, and think about how this process of dissection is an essential part of many experiments. 5.2.4 Drosophila disease models There are hundreds of disease models that have been generated in Drosophila - you can see a list on the FlyBase Disease Model page. Figure 5.5: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the FlyBase Disease model page https://flybase.org/lists/FBhh/. License: CC BY 4.0 There is even a blog to help keep track of Drosophila disease model developments. Many of these disease models are available through Drosophila Stock Centers - organizations that maintain collections of fly “strains” (distinct genotypes) and distribute them to researchers. When a researcher develops a new fly strain, they can submit it to a stock center so that other researchers can use it. 5.2.5 Summary Fruit flies share many commonalities with humans including organs and organ systems, anatomical organization, and genes. About 60 percent of all human genes, and about 75 percent of human disease-associated genes have orthologs in flies Fruit flies have a short generation time, produce many offspring, and are easy to work with in the lab. You can do lots of experiments without needing too much time or money. Many important discoveries have been made using fruit flies Fruit flies are used today for many types of research, from development to disease. Many human diseases can be modeled and studied in fruit flies.

These biological databases make vast amounts of scientific research freely available to anyone, as long as you know where to look. The following sections introduce a few of these databases, explaining where to find them, what kinds of information they contain, and how to use them. "],["database-intro.html", "6.1 Introduction to Biological Databases", " 6.1 Introduction to Biological Databases Figure 0.1: Logos from several biological databases Learning Objectives Explain what a biological database is and why it’s important Name 3 types of information that may be available in biological databases. 6.1.1 What is a biological database? The process of scientific discovery involves a great deal of collaboration. Different people do different experiments and find out different small pieces of the puzzle, and as we bring the information together we start to understand the big picture. This is true for expert scientists as well as beginners - we all need a way to find out what other people have already learned, and to share any new information we discover. An important part of collaboration is sharing the data we collect with each other. Recent technologies have allowed us to collect huge amounts of biological data. What kinds of data? Genomic DNA sequences of many organisms Gene activity across different organisms, tissues, and cell types Protein structures Enzymatic reactions and metabolic pathways Orthologs (genes that have similar sequences and functions across different organisms) Biological databases are a way for scientists to organize and share their data. Most of this data is publicly available, if you know where to look. We’ll take a quick look at some important biological databases to give you an idea of what’s out there. Many biological databases have websites for accessing the data. However, they are not always the most intuitive and user-friendly. It can be a bit overwhelming trying to explore these databases and understand the huge wealth of information they provide, even for experienced scientists. Don’t be afraid to ask for help! We will now take a quick tour of some important biological databases and see the types of information they have available. 6.1.2 GenBank (Genomes) The DNA sequence of the genomes for many important organisms can be found in the GenBank database. GenBank is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI). Here is the entry for the human genome. Figure 1.1: Katherine Cox (2020). Screenshot of Human Genome page from GenBank https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=human[organism]. License: CC BY 4.0 If you wanted, you could download it yourself! It wouldn’t make much sense to look at, it’s just a long series of A, T, C, and G. We need other computer programs and more research to help us make sense of the DNA sequence. But it is freely available for anyone to access. GenBank has many other sequences - whole genomes, individual genes, and partial sequences from many different organisms. This screenshot was taken in 2020. As you can see from the image, NCBI was being used to maintain a collection of resources for research on the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19. 6.1.3 OMIM (Genes) As genes are discovered, the scientists who discover them get to name them and give them a gene symbol. Usually the gene name tells you something about what the gene does. This system works pretty well, but sometimes there are problems - two scientists might both discover the same gene and give it two different names, or there might be two genes with similar functions that are given the same name. In order to keep accurate track of all these genes, each gene is given a unique ID number. There are a few databases (including GenBank) that act as central repositories for genes from all organisms. Then there are databases focused on individual organisms or specific categories of genes. One of the challenges of bioinformatics is keeping track of all the available information and matching up information from different databases. One example of an organism-specific database is the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. This database stores information about human genes and the diseases caused by mutations in these genes. Here is the entry for CFTR, from OMIM. Mutations in CFTR lead to cystic fibrosis: Figure 5.1: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator page from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man https://www.omim.org/entry/602421. License: CC BY 4.0 The top of the page lists the gene symbol and its location in the human genome, as well as phenotypes associated with the gene (how it affects the organism, including causing cystic fibrosis). If you scroll further down, it has much more information about what we know about the gene, what research has been done, and how studies are being carried out in other organisms to help us understand this gene. 6.1.4 Human Protein Atlas (Gene Activity) Besides just knowing gene sequences and location in the genome, scientists are interested in gathering data about where and when those genes are active (“expressed”). Knowing when and where a gene is active can help us figure out what it does. The Human Protein Atlas is one database that collects gene expression data for human genes. Here is the expression data for CFTR: Figure 5.2: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator page from Human Protein Atlas https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000001626-CFTR. License: CC BY 4.0 This screenshot is scrolled down a bit from the top of the page so you can see the expression data summary. As you can see, the CFTR gene is enriched in the pancreas, and is also expressed in a few other locations. It was not detected in the brain. If you click on either of these expression summaries you can get more detailed information. Further down on the page there is also information about subcellular localization (where in the cell is it located). 6.1.5 PDB (Protein Structures) Studying the structure of proteins can tell us something about how they work, or about what goes wrong when they don’t work. For example, sickle cell anemia is caused by a single mutation in a gene for a subunit of hemoglobin. This mutation causes the hemoglobin to stick together, forming long fibers that deform red blood cells. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) stores information about the structure of proteins. Here is the entry for Hemoglobin S (the sickle-cell form of hemoglobin) from PDB: Figure 5.3: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator page from Protein Data Bank https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2hbs. License: CC BY 4.0 Here you can view the structure and see information about how it was obtained, including what experimental methods were used and some statistics about how accurate we think the structure is, as well a link to the journal article for the structure. If you click on the 3D View tab you will see an interactive model that you can rotate, zoom in, and select specific amino acids. You can also download the structure, though you will need a program that knows how to interpret it in order to make much use of it. 6.1.6 Summary Biological databases make vast amounts of scientific research freely available to anyone. Different databases can hold many different types of data including genome sequences, gene functions and roles in diseases, gene expression, and protein structure. Biological databases can be a bit overwhelming to explore. Focus on finding the information you’re interested in, and don’t be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck. "],["database-flybase.html", "6.2 FlyBase", " 6.2 FlyBase Learning Objectives Use FlyBase to look up information about genes by name, gene symbol, or FlyBase ID number Use FlyBase to find fruit fly models of human disease 6.2.1 What is FlyBase? Figure 1.1: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase homepage https://flybase.org/. License: CC BY 4.0 FlyBase (flybase.org) is a website for the Drosophila scientific community that organizes research results about Drosophila. We can use it to find out what has been discovered about genes we’re interested in. There are many species of Drosophila. Most research is done using Drosophila melanogaster (abbreviated Dmel), but FlyBase also has information about other species of flies. 6.2.2 FlyBase Gene Pages One important role for FlyBase is keeping track of all the Drosophila genes and what we know about them. FlyBase maintains a webpage for each known Drosophila gene. FlyBase ID Every gene on FlyBase has a FlyBase ID number that looks like this: FBgnXXXXXXX, with the X’s being different numbers. FB stands for FlyBase and gn stands for gene. There are ~17000 Drosophila melanogaster genes. Each known Drosophila gene has its own FlyBase ID, and you can use the FlyBase ID to find information about the genes such as what they do and whether they are related to any human genes. Look up a gene on FlyBase You can look up a gene on FlyBase using the “Jump to Gene” search box. Figure 5.1: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase homepage https://flybase.org/. License: CC BY 4.0 Here is the page for the gene with FlyBase ID FBgn0000024. This page has a ton of useful information for finding out more about this gene! We’ll highlight a few important things to start with: Figure 5.2: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase gene page for Ace https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000024. License: CC BY 4.0 The gene Symbol and Name. Genes are usually named after what they do, and their symbol is a usually shortened version of the name. In this case, gene FBgn0000024 is named Acetylcholine esterase, and is abbreviated Ace. (The Dmel stands for Drosophila melanogaster.) The Gene Snapshot gives a quick summary of what we know about this gene. In this case, it’s an enzyme involved in neurotransmission. Gene Ontology Further down the page are the Gene Ontology or GO terms. There are 3 categories of GO terms: Molecular Function: What does this gene do at a molecular level? How does it interact with other molecules? (Examples: enzyme - catalyzes a reaction, DNA binding - binds to DNA, transporter - moves something across a membrane) Biological Process: What does this gene do for the organism? What’s the “big picture”? (Examples: involved in development, reproduction, immune system, etc.) Cellular Component: Where in a cell is the gene found? (Examples: the nucleus, mitochondria, cell membrane, etc.) Figure 5.3: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the Gene Ontology section of the FlyBase gene page for Ace https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000024#function. License: CC BY 4.0 For the Ace gene, we can see its molecular functions include acetylcholinesterase activity (it’s an enzyme). You can click on these terms to find out more about them. For example, if you click on “acetylcholinesterase activity” you can find out more about the reaction that is being catalyzed, and find other genes that carry out this same reaction. You can also see from this table how we know this information - it tells you what kind of evidence we have to prove it, and it links to the paper where that evidence came from. Other information This page contains a lot of other information, including any known interactions of this gene with other genes, information about similar genes in other organisms (orthologs), and whether related genes are relevant to any human diseases (we will discuss how to explore these in the next section). As you investigate Drosophila data and find genes that you want to learn more about, FlyBase is a good place to start. Some genes are unknowns There are some genes that we still don’t know anything about. We can tell from the DNA sequence that there is a protein encoded there because we can see a long string of codons for amino acids. But we’ve never discovered what that protein does. More research is needed! Here’s an example of an unknown gene: Figure 5.4: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase gene page for unknown gene CG14448 https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0037191. License: CC BY 4.0 As you can see, it doesn’t have a name - we don’t know what to name it since we don’t know anything about it. There is also no information for the gene snapshot. Unknown genes can be frustrating or disappointing, since they don’t provide us with any information. But they can also be exciting - maybe this data is a step towards finding out what they do! Use FlyBase to investigate labial The labial gene (gene symbol: lab) gene is a gene involved in the copper region of the Drosophila midgut, as well as controlling the identity of segments that contribute to the head and the anterior thorax. We can use FlyBase to learn more about this gene. In most datasets, genes will be listed by an ID number rather than their name, such as the FlyBase ID number (FBgn number). We can use FlyBase to find these IDs and match them up to data in the dataset we’re investigating. Exercise Go to FlyBase and search for “lab” in the “Jump to Gene” searchbar. What is the FlyBase ID number for lab? What biological processes is the lab gene involved in? 6.2.3 Finding Orthologs FlyBase also contains information about orthologs for each of the FlyBase genes. Orthologs are genes that have similar sequences and functions across species. Finding orthologs can be challenging - the sequences are similar, but not identical, and it can be hard to predict whether the gene is likely to be doing the same thing in other species. There are several different computer programs that will analyze genes (using different features, including their nucleotide and amino acid sequences, predicted structures, and genome locations) to try to identify orthologs. DIOPT to the rescue! With so many options for finding orthologs, how do you know which one to use? Fortunately, we don’t have to choose. DIOPT (DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool) is a convenient tool that combines and summarizes information from several different ortholog prediction programs. Rather than having to pick a single program, you can look at the DIOPT score and see how many of the programs think that a particular gene is an ortholog. The DIOPT score is very straightforward: out of the total number of ortholog prediction programs, how many of them predicted this gene was an ortholog? As of writing this tutorial, there are 15 programs for predicting fly-human orthologs, so a score of 7 means 7 out of those 15 programs think that the gene is an ortholog. FlyBase uses DIOPT to report orthologs. If you scroll down and expand the Orthologs section for a gene, you can see the list of potential orthologs and their DIOPT scores for several different species, including humans. It also tells you which programs did or did not predict that particular ortholog. Here are the top few predicted human orthologs for the Ace gene: Figure 5.5: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the Orthologs section of the FlyBase gene page for Ace https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000024#orthologs. License: CC BY 4.0 In the results, “Hsap” stands for Homo sapiens, and the letters and numbers after the slash are the gene symbol. You can click on these gene symbols to find out more about the human genes. As you can see, the first two results (BCHE and ACHE) score quite well (10 out of 15 and 9 out of 15), so there’s a pretty good chance that they are orthologs. It’s not uncommon for there to be multiple human genes that are orthologs of a single fly gene - humans have larger and more complex genomes, so they may have multiple specialized versions of a gene where flies only need a single version. The rest of the results do not score very high and are much less likely to be true orthologs. Once you know the likely human orthologs, you can then research those genes in other databases and scientific literature. We can go back and forth between flies, humans, and other species and compare what we know across all species to try to build up an understanding of what the gene does and what happens when it stops working correctly. Exercise Go back to the FlyBase page for the lab gene. What is the most likely human ortholog for the lab gene? How many programs think this gene is an ortholog of lab? 6.2.4 Disease models Because disease models are of particular interest, there is a special section in the FlyBase gene report about relationships between that FlyBase gene and any human diseases. Note that there are 3 types of relationships that are reported: Models Based on Experimental Evidence: someone has studied flies with disruptions to this gene and has shown that the flies have similar symptoms to humans Potential Models Based on Orthology: we think this gene could be used to study a particular disease because we think it’s an ortholog, but we don’t have proof. Modifiers Based on Experimental Evidence: this gene doesn’t directly cause a disease, but makes a disease caused by a different gene better or worse Disease report for the Ace gene The Ace gene has no known or predicted relationship to any human diseases, so its report is pretty boring in this section: Figure 6.1: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the Human Disease Associations section of the FlyBase gene page for Ace https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000024#hdm. License: CC BY 4.0 Huntington’s Disease Let’s take a look at something more interesting. Say we’ve heard that scientists are using fruit flies to study Huntington’s disease. Can we use FlyBase to find out more? FlyBase has lots of information besides just reports about specific genes. If you go to the FlyBase homepage and scroll down to the Quick Search box, you can see some of the categories of information available. Let’s search for the Huntington’s disease model: Go to the FlyBase homepage In the Quick Search box, select “Human Disease” Enter “Huntington’s disease” Figure 6.2: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of FlyBase QuickSearch https://flybase.org/. License: CC BY 4.0 This will give you a list of everything related to Huntington’s disease on FlyBase: Figure 6.3: Katherine Cox (2021). search results for Huntington’s disease on FlyBase https://flybase.org/. License: CC BY 4.0 At the top we see: The Human Disease Model report - information about models for this disease The Disease Ontology report - information from a database about human diseases The Gene Report for the human (Homo sapiens) gene: Hsap/HTT The Gene Report for the Drosophila homolog: Dmel/htt The Human Disease Model report is a good place to start. Clicking on this result takes us to the full report. At the top we can see some information about the disease, including a brief overview of the disease and a link to the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database entry for the disease: Figure 6.4: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the top of the FlyBase Human Disease Model page for Huntington’s disease https://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000024. License: CC BY 4.0 Further down the page, there is a section describing the relevant Drosophila gene(s): Figure 6.5: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the Drosophila Gene Information section of the FlyBase page for the Huntington’s disease Human Disease Model https://flybase.org/reports/FBhh0000003#dmel_gene_info. License: CC BY 4.0 Investigate the htt gene Now that we know the htt gene is used to model Huntington’s disease, let’s find out more about this gene. Exercise Look up the Gene report for the htt gene. The easiest way to do this is to type “htt” in the Jump to Gene box. What biological processes is the htt gene involved in? How many different alleles (versions of the gene) can be used as models of Huntington’s disease, based on experimental evidence? htt alleles (variant forms of the gene) Here we can see that there are actually multiple different variants of the htt gene that have been experimentally shown to cause symptoms similar to Huntington’s disease in flies. These variants all have different types of mutations affecting the htt gene. It can be useful to have different versions of the gene that all mimic Huntington’s disease. Depending how these mutations were made or discovered, they can be useful for different types of experiments. Also, if experiments turn out the same for several different disease-causing mutations, it’s more likely that the result will transfer to other organisms, and isn’t just a quirk of a particular mutation. 6.2.5 Summary FlyBase is a fantastic source of information. You can use FlyBase to find: Gene functions and interactions Orthologs (Drosophila genes that are related to genes in other species, including humans) Drosophila genes that are relevant to human diseases The name, symbol or ID number for a gene, so you can research it on other databases. 6.2.5.1 Learn More FlyBase is designed to help scientists do research, so it has a lot of information, and we’ve just looked at a few of the basic features. Here are some resources if you’d like to learn more: Check out the “Help” tab on FlyBase Visit FlyBase TV, the FlyBase YouTube channel Look at the FlyBase “New to Flies” wiki page "],["database-hpa.html", "6.3 Human Protein Atlas", " 6.3 Human Protein Atlas Learning Objectives Use the Human Protein Atlas to look up proteins by name and find out where they are localized. 6.3.1 What is the Human Protein Atlas? The Human Protein Atlas is a website that organizes research results about human proteins. It contains many types of information, including what the proteins do, where they are active, and what types of diseases they are involved in. We can use it to find out what has been discovered about genes we’re interested in. Figure 1.1: Katherine Cox (2021). Screenshot of the Human Protein Atlas homepage https://www.proteinatlas.org/. License: CC BY 4.0 You will primarily interact with the Human Protein Atlas by typing the names of genes or proteins of interest into the search bar. The boxes below the search bar (“Tissue Atlas”, “Cell Atlas”, etc.) provide explanations about the types of information available in the Human Protein Atlas. Reminder: Genes and Proteins People sometimes use the names of a gene and the protein it “codes for” interchangeably, which can be a bit confusing. A gene is a DNA sequence (made of nucleotides). It contains the instructions for how to make a specific protein. A protein is an amino acid sequence. Proteins fold up into specific shapes that let them do their jobs. Proteins perform the majority of functions in cells, including things like: Carrying out chemical reactions Moving materials around inside the cell Transporting things in and out of a cell Mutations in a gene can cause the protein to be made incorrectly, resulting in a protein that does not do its job properly. Not all genes code for proteins; genes can have other types of information and instructions. The Human Protein Atlas is focused specifically on proteins and the genes that code for them (“protein-coding genes”). 6.3.2 Protein Pages Every protein in the Human Protein Atlas has its own page with a large collection of information about the protein. To see what kinds of information is available, we will look at the entry for insulin. Protein Summary Figure 5.1: Katherine Cox (2023). Screenshot of the top of the Human Protein Atlas page for INS https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000254647-INS. License: CC BY 4.0 Gene name - The name of the gene that codes for the protein. If multiple names have been used for this gene, they will be listed in parentheses. The gene for insulin is named “INS”. Protein class - The Human Protein Atlas designates different “classes” for proteins, which are a bit like tags in a blog - they group proteins into collections based on some common property. These classes are based on where the protein is located, what the protein does, and what diseases the protein is involved in. Insulin is in multiple disease classes, because it is involved in both diabetes and cancer. It is also in the plasma proteins class because it is found in plasma. Protein Expression and Localization - Where is the protein located? The Human Protein Atlas has several types of information about the protein’s location, such as the tissues, brain regions, and subcellular compartments where the protein has been observed. More detailed information is available by clicking on the tabs along the top of the page. Further down the page we can see more information about what the protein does: Figure 5.2: Katherine Cox (2023). Screenshot of the Protein Function section of the Human Protein Atlas page for INS https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000254647-INS. License: CC BY 4.0 What does it do? (Protein function, Molecular function, Biological process) - What molecular, chemical, and biological processes does it carry out? Insulin is a hormone involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Gene summary (at the bottom) - A summary of what we know about this gene. For insulin, it contains a description of how it is processed, and then an explanation of how it binds to the insulin receptor and stimulates glucose uptake. Tissue Atlas If we click on the Tissue tab, we can see more detailed information. Partway down the page you can see diagrams of where the protein is located. Figure 5.3: Katherine Cox (2023). Screenshot of the RNA and Protein Expression Summary section of the Tissue page for INS from the Human Protein Atlas https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000254647-INS/tissue. License: CC BY 4.0 Insulin is very cleanly localized to the pancreas. Both the RNA and the protein experimental data show high expression in the pancreas and very little expression anywhere else. Subcellular Localization If we click on the Subcell tab, we can see more detailed information about where in a cell the protein can be found. Insulin is secreted rather than remaining in the cell, so it doesn’t have a subcellular localization. Instead, let’s look at the subcellular localization of the insulin receptor INSR, which is the protein that detects the presence of insulin so that cells can respond to it. Figure 5.4: Katherine Cox (2023). Screenshot of the Summary section of the Subcell page for INSR from the Human Protein Atlas https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000254647-INS/tissue. License: CC BY 4.0 The insulin receptor is located mainly on the plasma membrane. This makes sense - it sits on the outside of the cell so that it can detect insulin. It can also be found in vesicles, which transport materials to and from the plasma membrane. Look up a Protein Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a severe disease where individuals are unable to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. If untreated, children with PKU develop seizures and irreversible intellectual disabilities. It can be controlled by maintaining a strict diet, and individuals can go on to live a normal life. Babies are routinely screened for PKU shortly after birth, so that they can begin treatment immediately. PKU is caused by deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase - the protein that processes phenylalanine. Exercise Go to the Human Protein Atlas and enter “Phenylalanine hydroxylase” in the search bar to find out more about this protein. What is the name of the gene that encodes this protein? What tissues is this gene expressed in? Where in the cell is it localized? 6.3.3 Summary The Human Protein Atlas is a useful source of information when researching human genes.
