### Overview{-}

#### Purpose {-}

The two activities in this assignment will familiarize you with the concepts of model organisms, with an emphasis on *Drosophila* (fruit flies).

#### Learning Objectives {-}

1. Explain the importance of model organisms and identify some of their desirable characteristics. 
1. Describe the usefulness of *Drosophila* as a model system.

#### Introduction {-}

Scientists frequently use a few specific organisms, called **model organisms** for their experiments. The first activity will give a general overview of model organisms, introduce a few of the most popular model organisms and discuss why these organisms were chosen and what they are useful for.

The fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) is a popular model organism used to study a wide range of biological questions. The second activity will introduce you to some of the types of research being conducted with fruit flies, give a brief overview of *Drosophila* biology, and show you what itâ€™s like to work with *Drosophila* in the lab.
