# Exercises: Biological Databases

Scientists often use online databases to store and share their research.  These biological databases make vast amounts of scientific research freely available to anyone, as long as you know where to look.  This lab will introduce you to a few of these databases by teaching you where to find them, what kinds of information they contain, and how to use them.
