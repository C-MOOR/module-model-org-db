# Instructor Guide {-}

This module has two key goals.  From a "fundamentals of biology" perspective, this module aims to help students gain an appreciation of genes, homology, and how model organisms can contribute to our understanding of a gene by giving them concrete examples to investigate.  From a "scientific practice" perspective, it aims to show them some of the publicly available scientific databases and give them confidence in exploring them to find information about a gene of interest.
 
### Teaching Recommendations {-}

This module is designed to be flexible - it can be completed in a single lab period, or the component pieces can be split apart to be used at different times (e.g. at home vs. in-class, or across multiple class days).  We have primarily used it as a single lab period, but have also used it as a "flipped-classroom" activity in a lecture course, assigning portions as homework and completing the "project" portion in class.

The "Example Lab" portion of this book demonstrates how we typically organize the material for a single lab period of an introductory biology course.
