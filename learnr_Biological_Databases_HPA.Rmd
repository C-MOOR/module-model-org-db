```{r pku-quiz}
quiz(caption = "Investigate phenylalanine hydroxylase",
  question("What is the name of this gene?",
    answer("PKU"),
    answer("PAH", correct = TRUE),
    answer("PHE"),
    answer("Phenylalanine"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("What tissues is this gene expressed in?  HINT: Choose 3",
    answer("Stomach"),
    answer("Liver", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Spleen"),
    answer("Gallbladder", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Kidney", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Small intestine"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("Where in the cell is it localized?  HINT: Choose 2",
    answer("Nucleus"),
    answer("Cytoplasm"),
    answer("Extracellular matrix"),
