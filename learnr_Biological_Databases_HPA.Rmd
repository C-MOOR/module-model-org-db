## Look up a Protein

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a severe disease where individuals are unable to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine.  If untreated, children with PKU develop seizures and irreversible intellectual disabilities.  It can be controlled by maintaining a strict diet, and individuals can go on to live a normal life.  Babies are routinely screened for PKU shortly after birth, so that they can begin treatment immediately.

PKU is caused by deficiency in **phenylalanine hydroxylase** - the protein that processes phenylalanine.

Go to the Human Protein Atlas and enter "Phenylalanine hydroxylase" in the search bar to find out more about this protein.

```{r pku-quiz}
quiz(caption = "Investigate phenylalanine hydroxylase",
  question("What is the name of this gene?",
    answer("PKU"),
    answer("PAH", correct = TRUE),
    answer("PHE"),
    answer("Phenylalanine"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("What tissues is this gene expressed in?  HINT: Choose 3",
    answer("Stomach"),
    answer("Liver", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Spleen"),
    answer("Gallbladder", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Kidney", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Small intestine"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
  question("Where in the cell is it localized?  HINT: Choose 2",
    answer("Nucleus"),
    answer("Cytoplasm"),
    answer("Extracellular matrix"),
    answer("Endoplasmic reticulum", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Mitochondria"),
    answer("Vesicles", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
