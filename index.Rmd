# About {-}

This module introduces students to model organisms and biological databases and the roles they play in scientific research.  At a more fundamental level, it illuminates the concepts of genes and homology.  By using databases to explore genes and their homologs, students will gain a deeper appreciation of the commonalities that exist across organisms and the ways in which this can help us conduct scientific research.

### Audience and Prerequisites {-}

This module is designed for introductory biology courses.  Key ideas center around genes and homologs, and the proteins they encode.  We typically include this module as part of a Molecular Biology unit.

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of genes and homology

The project portion of the module involves looking up genes in different databases (human and model organism). Students should have a basic understanding of what a gene is (and why we care about them), and why it makes sense to study similar genes (i.e. homologs) across different organisms.  This module will help solidify these concepts by having students investigate concrete examples of genes and their homologs.

<!--
**Prerequisites**: None

A minimal but sufficient explanation of genes and homology is included as part of the module, so students should be able to complete it at any point.

1. Describe the purpose of model organisms and identify some of their desirable characteristics. 
1. Use online databases to look up information about a gene.
1. Explain how studying homologous genes across species can help further our understanding of those genes.
