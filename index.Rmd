# About {-}

This module introduces students to model organisms and biological databases and the roles they play in scientific research.  At a more fundamental level, it illuminates the concepts of genes and homology.  By using databases to explore genes and their homologs, students will gain a deeper appreciation of the commonalities that exist across organisms and the ways in which this can help us conduct scientific research.

### Target Audience and Prerequisites {-}

This module is designed for introductory biology courses.  Key ideas center around genes and homologs, and the proteins they encode.  We typically include this module as part of a Molecular Biology unit.

Prerequisites: None

  - A minimal but sufficient explanation of genes and homology is included as part of the module, so students should be able to complete it at any point.
